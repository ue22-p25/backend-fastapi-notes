# A Notes App in FastAPI - step by step

## Purpose

This repo describes how to build **a notes app with FastAPI**, from scratch, and
step by step.  
Each step outlines a specific feature, and how to implement it.

It's probably best not to try and implement the code yourself, since that would
drain your bandwidth, and in any case the final code is available in the repo;
instead, you can read through the code and comments, and figure out how it
works.

## Layouts

there are 2 layouts available for the material in this activity; depending on
your preference, you can choose either one:

- <Link href="/scrollycoding">dual-column scrolly-coding</Link> (preferred)
  you'll get comments on the left hand side and code changes on the right hand side

- <Link href="/singlecolumn">traditional single-column layout</Link>
  a more usual, single column layout;
  for each step you get a presentation first, and then the code changes

## Implementation

Just so you know, this material is put together using `Next.js`, and the
code snippets are rendered using `codehike`.
