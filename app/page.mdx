# Chat App step by step

there are 2 layouts available for the material in this activity

- <Link href="/scrollycoding">dual-column scrolly-coding</Link> (preferred)
  you'll get comments on the left hand side and code changes on the right hand side

- <Link href="/singlecolumn">traditional single-column layout</Link>
  a more usual, single column layout; for each step you get a presentation first, and then the code changes
